Program reviewed by the University of California, Riverside

---------------------------------------------------
In this project we created a program named "rshell" which
is supposed to act like a normal BASH Command Shell.
It executes commands inputted by the user using the execvp
function and also has a special exit command which exits
the program.
---------------------------------------------------

Bugs

--------------------------------------------------
1. || and && do not work, as i was not able to get
them to work.
2. the command "cd" does not work
3. execvp will claim a file name is too long when there are
around 300 characters
4. if you put around 550 commands into the program it will crash.
5. after putting comment, previous command will print twice
6. after putting script, the program closes
